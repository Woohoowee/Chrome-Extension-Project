## Configuration

T2S does not provide customization options beyond language and voice selection. Users can choose their preferred language and voice from the extension's pop-up window.

## Web Scraper

To retrieve the necessary data for text-to-speech conversion, the extension utilizes a web scraper to access an API provider. This allows the extension to fetch the required content and generate the speech output accurately.
